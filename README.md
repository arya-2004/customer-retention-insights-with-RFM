- Pandas, NumPy
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub

Project Summary:
- Cleaned and merged order-related datasets
- Calculated RFM metrics:
  - Recency: days since the most recent purchase

  - Monetary: total value spent
- Assigned RFM scores using fixed thresholds
- Created customer segments:
  - Best Customers
  - Lapsed High Value
  - Recent High Value
  - Recent Low Value
  - Others
- Built a Power BI dashboard showing:
  - Customer count by segment
